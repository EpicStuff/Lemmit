# Lemmit

A Reddit-to-Lemmy cross-poster.

## To do:
- TESTS!
- Dockerize
- monitor `!requests` community for new subreddits to sync
- Create a watcher that periodically checks for updates (edits / deletes) on reddit post and sync those:
  * 1 hour, day, week, month after posting.
  * Automatically when reported (within reason)
