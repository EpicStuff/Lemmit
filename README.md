# Lemmit

A Reddit-to-Lemmy cross-poster.

## To do:
- MORE TESTS!
- monitor `!requests` community for new subreddits to sync
- Create a watcher that periodically checks for updates (edits / deletes) on reddit post and sync those:
  * 1 hour, day, week, month after posting.
  * Automatically when reported (within reason)
- Toggle between copying **All** or just the **Hot** posts?
  * Select between All/Hot when adding, based on posts/day
  * In case of All: have minimum vote threshold?
